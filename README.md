==========

_etlmodexep_ stands for _ET:Legacy mod executable patcher_. This tool patches some binaries from buggy well-known mods, allowing them to be hosted by ET:Legacy. The name is inspired by the [v200exep](http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/247/24753.html) tool.

Warning
-------

This patch must be use with ET:Legacy servers only. Never use it for ET:Legacy clients. If you want to host a game and play on the same computer, launch the dedicated server with another user.
